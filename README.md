<h1 align="center">PhantomSense: A Ghost Hunting Device</h1>

This repository contains the code and documentation for a custom-built **PhantomSense** device designed to detect paranormal activity. The device uses a combination of **DHT11 sensors** and a **TTP223B Capacitive Touch Sensor** to confirm the presence of spirits based on changes in temperature and touch interaction.

## How It Works

Thereâ€™s a hypothesis suggesting that the manifestation of a spirit causes a localized drop in temperature. To test this, the design leverages a TTP223B touch sensor in conjunction with three DHT11 temperature sensors. When a spirit interacts with the TTP223B, the two DHT11 sensors positioned nearby should register a temperature drop. A third DHT11 sensor, placed on the opposite side of the device, monitors the room's ambient temperature. By comparing these readings, we can determine if the drop in temperature near the TTP223B is anomalous. If the TTP223B registers contact and the temperature near the front two DHT11 sensors is significantly lower than the ambient room temperature, it suggests possible interaction by a spirit.
